# WPTT Development

The plan is to bundle up a bunch of development functions in to a singel plugin so we don't have them duplicated all over the place.

### Future Plans

- log all emails locally and in dev
- define local/dev/live environments so we can do different things depending
- make it easy to define which plugins should be activated in each environment
- make it easy to allow options set based on plugins activated in different environments
